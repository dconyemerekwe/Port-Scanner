# Python Port Scanner

This is a simple Python script on a specified IP address within a given range. This project helped me deepen my understanding of network programming and socket handling by rewriting and enhancing an existing script from a video tutorial.

## Project Overview
This port scanner attempts to establish TCP connection to the target IP on a range of ports, reporting which ports are open. It can be used for basic network analysis and learning about how ports work on a networked device.

## How to Use

1. Update the target IP address in the script or input it when running.  
2. Run the script with Python by typing this in your command prompt:  
   ```bash
   py portscanner.py
   ```
3. The script will scan the specified IP address for open ports within the defined range and display the results.

## Screenshots

The output shows the port scanner script running against a target IP address. It lists all open TCP ports found within the scanned port range, showing active network services on these ports.

## Legal Notice
Only scan IP addresses and devices you have explicit permission to scan. Unauthorised scanning of networks or devices can be illegal and unethical.
